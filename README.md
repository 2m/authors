`sbt-authors` is an [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org) plugin that produces a nicely formatted summary of authors that contributed to a project between two points in git history.

Inspired by:
* The original idea by [@rkuhn](https://github.com/rkuhn) who came up with [authors.pl](https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/v2.5.6/scripts/authors.pl) using now unknown archaic language
* The rewrite of the original script by [@johanandren](https://github.com/johanandren) who gave us the magnificent [authors.scala](https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/v2.5.6/scripts/authors.scala)

## Setup

Add this to your sbt build plugins, in either `project/plugins.sbt` or `~/.sbt/1.0/plugins/build.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("lt.dvim.authors" % "sbt-authors" % "<latest version>")
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("jypma", "maven") // for ts-reaktive
```

`sbt-authors` is an AutoPlugin and therefore that is all that is required.

## Tasks

* `authors <from> <to>` Fetches the authors summary between two tags and puts it to your clipboard.
